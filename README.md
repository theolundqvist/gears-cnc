# Gears to CNC

A Unity-based tool for generating G-Code to cut precisely spaced holes in CNC-machined plates for gear assemblies. Originally built for use in educational gear puzzles, the tool features automatic route optimization to minimize total tool travel distance.

## ‚ú¶ Key Features
- **G-Code Generation**: Automatically generates CNC-compatible G-Code for gear hole layouts.
- **Route Optimization**: Integrates a modified Ant Colony Optimization algorithm to reduce toolpath length.
- **Educational Use**: Designed for hands-on learning in preschool and primary schools, with [Komtek Halmstad](https://www.halmstad.se/barnochutbildning/teknikochentreprenorsskolankomtek.n2636.html).
- **Built in Unity**: Includes an intuitive interface for visualizing gear placement and toolpaths.

## ‚ú¶ Example Use
Gears were laser-cut from plexiglass and used in physical puzzle activities in schools. The route optimization significantly reduced the cutting distance ‚Äî from 158 cm down to 64 cm.

## ‚ú¶ Algorithm Details
The route optimization is based on [Dr. James McCaffrey‚Äôs Ant Colony Optimization algorithm](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2012/february/test-run-ant-colony-optimization), adapted and extended for CNC use cases.
